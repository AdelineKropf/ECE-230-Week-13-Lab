## Lab Questions

### Compare and contrast One Hot and Binary encodings

### Which method did your team find easier, and why?

    Our group found the One Hot easier because it was more intuitive having a flip flop for each of the states
    instead of trying to work in binary.

### In what conditions would you have to use one over the other? Think about resource utilization on the FPGA.
    
    You would need to use the Binary encoding if you didn't have as many flip flops to use...
